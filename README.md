The CRUD module is also an example of how abstraction in programming can create adaptable software. By abstracting the database operations, the same CRUD module could potentially be used in future projects with minimal changes, regardless of the specific requirements of the new project. This reusability is a significant advantage, reducing development time and increasing reliability through the reuse of tested code.

For the database and dashboard requirements requested by Grazioso Salvare, the approach started with understanding the specific needs, such as the types of queries that would be most useful for their operations and the best way to visualize this information. This project was different from previous assignments because it required more integrated solution that combined both backend database design and interaction with a frontend dashboard. For futrue projects making sure that the key requirements are layed out ensures development will align with the clients needs.

Computer scientists play a role in solving complex problems using technology, developing software and systems that can significantly enhance processes. For this project, this was seen by creating a dashboard that would help Grazioso Salvare analyze animal rescue data, identify data trends, make data-driven decisions, which would lead to saving more animals in need. This project showed myself how computer science can contribute to society all while helping an organization achieve their goals more effectively.
